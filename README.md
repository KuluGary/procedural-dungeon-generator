# Procedural dungeon generator

This is an implementation of procedural generation for Godot 4.x. It includes floorplan generation, room management and camera transitions between rooms.

This is intended as a prototype / skeleton for further development, and it is not intended as a starter kit for roguelike / roguelite games.

This implementation is based around te article wrote [BorisTheBrave](https://www.boristhebrave.com/2020/09/12/dungeon-generation-in-binding-of-isaac/) and its JavaScript implementation.

If you're interested, I also recommend [Florian Himsl's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-HIA6-LBJc) explanation on the algorithm for [The Binding of Isaac](https://store.steampowered.com/app/113200/The_Binding_of_Isaac/).
